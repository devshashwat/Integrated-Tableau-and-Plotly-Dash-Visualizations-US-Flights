# Integrated-Tableau-and-Plotly-Dash-Visualizations-US-Flights


Abstractâ€” The U.S. Department of Transportation's TranStats service makes available various metrics for 15 U.S. airlines and 30 major U.S airports. They also have simple visualizations as it pertains to this information. However, in order to best extract insights from this data, there needs to be a simple, interactive tool which allows people to deal with this data in a hands on manner. In this project, Plotly Dash and Tableau has been integrated to create a web based tool which allows users to interact with this raw data in an intuitive manner, and gain a broad overview of the aviation industry in the United States

1 INTRODUCTION
The project explores the interpretation of data from the United States Department of Transportation by using visual analytics methodology and principles. The project focuses on the data from the aviation industry. Visualization about passenger details, revenue statistics, common flight routes, and flight delay statistics were created.
In the flight delay statistics we further analysed the various causes of delay in different airports and how much each cause contributes to also categorize the best and worst performing airlines and airports. All this was put together in a single, intuitive web app.
